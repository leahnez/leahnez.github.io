I was born of the Salt Clan and born for the Water Edge People. My maternal grandfather is of the Under His Cover Clan and my paternal grandfather is of the Red Running into the Water People. In this way, I am a Navajo woman. I am currently living in Cleveland.\n\n\nI am a PhD student in Bioethics & Health Humanities at Case Western Reserve University and a T32 Scholar in the CTSC. My work focuses on community-based research, and ethical frameworks in genomics and public health with Indigenous communities. I am currently involved in projects centered on culturally informed genomics education materials and participatory research methods for further understanding what community members want from genomics research.\nOn this website, you will find my published work. You will also find news about my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. Please look around and hopefully we can stay in contact!\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss any potential projects."

    "text": "I have worked in research as an intern or assistant in various labs and offices. These roles have grounded me in community-engaged, qualitative, and ethics-focused work that directly informs my current PhD training in bioethics and health humanities.\n\nSummer Research Assistant\nMaxwell J. Mehlman, JD\nCase Western Reserve University\nKim Kaphingst, ScD\nUniversity of Utah\nIn this role, I worked for a collaborative project between Case Western Reserve University and the University of Utah. My work has included conducting individual interviews with participants and helping to develop the codebook for qualitative analysis. This work deepened my thinking about nudging in research ethics and how to think through those considerations in my future work.\n\n\n\nProfessional Research Assistant\nKatrina G. Claw, PhD\nUniversity of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus\nWorking with Dr. Claw, I contribute to genomics and bioethics projects centered around my Tribe. My responsibilities have included literature review, qualitative coding, and manuscript preparation, as well as assisting with curriculum and materials for community-facing educational outreach. This work gave me experience in community-based participatory research, Tribal policy, and approaches that center Indigenous sovereignty and relational accountability in genomic science.\n\n\n\nSummer Intern and Post-Bac Fellow\nSara Chandros Hull, PhD\nNational Institutes of Health, National Human Genome Research Institute, Tribal Health Research Office\nWith Dr. Hull and the Tribal Health Research Office at the NIH, I gained experience in how literature research supports broader projects focused on the ethics and governance of Tribal health research within U.S. federal government. My work has involved background research on policy and guidance documents, training in Institutional Review Board meetings, and contributions to public presentations and manuscripts. These experiences have given me a foundational view of how federal structures are trying to address Tribal priorities in health research, and how ethics can help push those structures toward respecting Tribal sovereignty."
