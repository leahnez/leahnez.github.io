>> Hello, my name is Leah Nez! I was born of the Salt Clan and born for the Water Edge People. My maternal grandfather is of the Under His Cover Clan and my paternal grandfather is of the Red Running into the Water People. In this way, I am a Navajo woman. I am currently living in Cleveland.

I am a PhD student in Bioethics & Health Humanities at Case Western Reserve University and a T32 Scholar in the CTSC. My work focuses on community-based research, and ethical frameworks in genomics and public health with Indigenous communities. I am currently involved in projects centered on culturally informed genomics education materials and participatory research methods for further understanding what community members want from genomics research.

On this website, you will find my published work. You will also find news about my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. Please look around and hopefully we can stay in contact!

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:fln3@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss any potential projects.
